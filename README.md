My younger self would be so proud of the person I am today; I am living a dream that started when I was 12 years old. My passion for art and computers is something that has grown with me for years now. Everything up to this point has been to make that little girl proud. Now I continue to design because I love it. The satisfaction that comes with finishing a project better everytime is my goal. I achieve it by making sure everything I create is pixel perfect for me and little me.
