      <p>My younger self would be so proud of the person I am today; I am living a dream that started when I was 12 years old. My passion for art and computers is something that has grown with me for years now. Everything up to this point has been to make that little girl proud. Now I continue to design because I love it. The satisfaction that comes with finishing a project better everytime is my goal. I achieve it by making sure everything I create is pixel perfect for me and little me.</p>

        <p>My app works with smart Mirror technology to show the user a better way to work out.
  You star by taking a video of yourself with the Mirror or if itâ€™s a moving sport/work out (such as running) you can use a special case and your phone camera. The app processes the information, then when you connect to the mirror the information is displayed on your body...</p>

      <h2>The Immatation Game</h2>
      <p>This peice is a quote book. I chose The Imitation Game, for this quote book, because of my admiration and respect for Alin Turing. I wanted to focus on his relationship with Joan Clarke. I found she brought something to his very stable existence that shook him up and brought colour to his world.
