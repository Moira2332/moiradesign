      <h1 itemprop="name">The Immatation Game</h1>
      <p>I chose The Imitation Game because of my admiration and respect for Alin Turing. I wanted to focus on his relationship with Joan Clarke. I found she brought something to his very stable existence that shook him up and brought colour to his world. I have decided to use a white page with a spacious design using a font such as Futura for Alan but adding watercolor and a script font done by hand for Joan. My design will be somewhat miss matched but I plan to find a way to make the contrasting fonts cohesive through having strict space sizing and a fluent spacious pattern with the text.</p>
